# dota2-stats
======================

## Purpose
For a small EDA I needed the data of all matches of different players.<p>
With the help of this little script I get the information from opendota.com

## Usage
run pip to ensure all requirements are fulfilled
 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
</br>

after that adjust the path of the data.csv
</br>
</br>
now you can run the script:

```bash
main.py -p PLAYERID
```
